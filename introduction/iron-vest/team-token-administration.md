# Team Token Administration

Set team token vesting with special administrative controls

1. With team tokens, the inability to stop vesting if a team member leaves the project before meeting their commitments is a serious problem. This causes projects to handle team token vesting manually or lose a significant chunk of the allocated tokens to individuals no longer contributing to the growth of the organization. With administrative controls for team token vesting, the authorized party can update the vesting period through a multi-sig process.
