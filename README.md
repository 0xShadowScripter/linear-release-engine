# âš– Linear Release Engine

At Ferrum, we pride ourselves on creating solutions that add value to the industry by solving critical pain points. We've done this in the past with our staking solutions, bridging solutions, MultiSwap, and more. Now we are bringing the same methodical approach to vesting, staking rewards, and more.

The Linear Release Engine helps avoid sell pressure and dump days while giving the community, investors and advisors access to tokens on a per-second basis instead of waiting for months to get access to their tokens.&#x20;
